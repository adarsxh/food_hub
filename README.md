# Food Delivery Data Analysis 📊🍔

This project involves end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a food delivery dataset to uncover customer trends, operational inefficiencies, and business opportunities.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Data Exploration:** Univariate and multivariate analysis using histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and heatmaps to detect outliers, value ranges, and variable relationships.
- **Top Performers:** Identified top 5 restaurants and the most popular cuisine on weekends.
- **Pricing Strategy:** Found that 40% of orders cost over $20, indicating a premium customer base for targeted upselling.
- **Delivery Efficiency:** Analyzed total delivery duration by combining prep time and delivery time; flagged delays over 60 minutes.
- **Customer Loyalty:** Extracted top 3 frequent customers and suggested personalized discounts to retain them.
- **Multivariate Insights:** Observed strong correlation between cost and rating, and trends across cuisine types.
- **Promotional Readiness:** Shortlisted restaurants with 50+ reviews and average ratings above 4.0 for marketing campaigns.
- **Revenue Estimation:** Projected platform income using variable commission rates (15%–25%) based on order value.
- **Weekday vs Weekend:** Found delivery time discrepancies, recommending weekend-specific staffing strategies.
